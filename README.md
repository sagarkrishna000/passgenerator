# React + Vite

This application is created by @Sagar_Krishna using React + vite with Tailwind CSS. This is a basic random Password Generator application based on React with minimal CSS in it created as my first react project while learning Reactjs.
There are 2 checkboxes which allowes you to include and exclude Number and special characters. Also you can select the length of the password you want to generate (ranging from 8 characters to 18 characters). When you click on the copy button to copy the generated password, the text gets highlighted. Thank You.
